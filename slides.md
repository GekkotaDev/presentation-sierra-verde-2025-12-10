# Background of the Study {.block.view-transition-title.text-center}

<!--
The driving game genre has had a long and rich history, and much like other
genres has not shyed away from experimentation and innovation. From the highly
accurate physics models of Beam-N-G and iRacing to the more fantastical nature
of the Choro-Q games.

And in following that reign our group seeks to create an approachable yet fun
experience both to veterans and newcomers to this genre.

# Area of Investigation {.block.view-transition-title.text-center}

*Fresh takes on proven if not stale mechanics* {.block.text-center}

<!--
Our group had investigated areas regarding the approachability of the genre,
the accessibility of said games, and the mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics
framework of third party games and our own game's MDA framework.

# Game Overview {.block.view-transition-title.text-center}

*For a plot driven RPG with sentient cars* {.block.text-center}

<!--
For this slide we present a word for word verbatim copy of the game concept
and story as presented to the Game Design and Game Programming subjects given
the overlap.

# Concept & Story {.font-black.inline-block.view-transition-title}

:: left ::

### Concept

You're a sentient car in an open world roleplaying game engaging with and
helping the locals, and inadvertently get dragged up into an adventure

As the player you have free agency as to what their fate is with your actions
influencing the plot of the story.

:img{src="/images/reddit-TunaNOR-road-trip-adventure.webp" .opacity-1.-translate-y-1/2}

:: right ::

### Story

You're a fresh face in the state of Sierra Verde starting a new life in this
humble little place with your Uncle Rover helping you get to grips with your
new home

Of course though a newcomer like you needs cash so get a move on with finding
whatever odd-jobs you can

Perhaps you'll get your name out there! Make an impact on this place! ~~Please
the capitalist overlords who wish to only eek profits out of the land much to
the locals' detriment~~. **Adventures awaits!**

# `Ch. 2` REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

  “What can we learn from what others have done?”



---
layout: two-cols-title
color: navy
---

:: title ::

# Foreign Literatures {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

Primarily composed of documentation and other presentations.

:: left ::

- Godot game engine and assoc. documentation
- Engine Simulator by Ange Yaghi
- ~~Blender~~ Blockbench Wiki
- Material Maker documentation
- Multiple context aware dialog systems

:: right ::

The foreign literatures that were selected for inclusion into the project were primarily
concerning with the development of the game itself — in other words, what are the right
tools for the job?



---
layout: two-cols-title
color: navy
---

:: title ::

# Local Literatures {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

Less game development and more game design.

:: left ::

- The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #9
- “The Development of a 3D Game Engine” (Espiritu, Limcaoco, Santiago, 2003
- Build! Build! Build! and Build Better More programs
- TESDA Training Regulations Manual for 3D Game Development NC III

:: right ::

The selected local literatures here are geared towards game design and influencing the
direction of the plot.

# Foreign Games {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

:: left ::

- The Choro-Q games by far the biggest inspiration; a series of quirky car RPGs that have you going on adventures (e.g: become the president of the entire world)
- Despite Electronic Arts™, Need For Speed admittedly has high quality level design
- Forza Horizon rewarding the mere act of having fun driving.
- The PlayStation inspired graphics of games such as Ultrakill

# `Ch. 3`: METHODOLOGY {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

  “How is it done?”



---
layout: top-title
color: navy
---

:: title ::

# Design Version {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

:: content ::

The current minimum hardware it had been tested on

- Windows 11 25H2; Godot supports up to Windows 10
- AMD Ryzen 3700U (4-cores, January 2019)
- Integrated Radeon RX Vega 10 graphics; **current bottleneck**
- Runs on Hard Disk Drives; assumed to be less than 3 GB large when fully production ready.
- 24 GB RAM though guesstimated can run on devices with less than 8 GB RAM

<!--
In the design version it has currently met these requirements. While we suspect
that if it were to be completed it would consume 3 gigabytes in storages, it is
for now consuming about under a 100 megabytes of disk space.

 -->

layout: top-title

:: title ::

# Design Guidelines {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

:: content ::

Targets we strive to hit

- United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
- Low poly PSX style graphics
- Zero to Hero ~~(or bootlicker)~~ plot with a narrative around working odd-jobs and having fun
- Consistent 24+ FPS on Ryzen 7 3700U + Radeon RX Vega 10 integrated graphics



---
layout: section
color: navy

# Game Design Definition {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

<!--
The game intends on featuring multiple locations each with their own identity
within the state of Sierra Verde. With the game following a non-linear narrative
the player is free to explore and complete the game at their own pace and prefered
route.

 -->



---
layout: top-title
color: navy

:: title ::

# Game Architecture {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

:: content ::

- Menus for user navigation and accessibility
- Vertical Slice Architecture
- COTS ("Commercial" Off The Shelf) software — more free/libre and open source than commercial

<!--
For this slide we would like to acknowledge the architecture of our game from a
more technical standpoint. 

The project uses a layered architecture taking design cues from the vertical
slice architecture, and that it makes heavy use of off-the-shelf components;
for the components in particular we would like to borrow another set of slides
from the respective presentation of Game Design and Game Programming.

### Assets

:img{src="/images/muscle-car.png"}
:img{src="/images/kenney-logo.png" .block.w-1/2.ml-1/4.mt-4}

:: right ::

### Applications

- Godot
- Blockbench
- Material Maker
- Engine Simulator
- GitHub
  - GitHub Actions + Docker (via images)
- Visual Studio **Code**

<!--
Assets that have been downloaded online primarily are sourced from Kenney under
a public domain equivalent license (Creative Commons Zero) with additional
royalty free assets acquired from `itch dot io`

What had been designed in-house primarily relates to the default player character
model, in-game textures, and engine sounds which brings us to the next topic.

These in-house assets have been made with Blockbench, Material Maker, and the
last open source version of Engine Simulator to be used within Godot with an
IDE used in conjuction with Github where source code is committed to whilst
running any automated processes.

# Software (cont.)

Page `02`/`02`: Non-comprehensive set of libraries used

:: left ::

- .NET **9** Software Development Kit
- Heightmap Terrain
- Dialogic
- Godot Easy Vehicle Physics
- Nodot
- Panku Console
- Proton Scatter
- `shomykohai/quest-system`

:: right ::

- Road Generator
- `glass-brick/road-generator`
- Shaker
- Nathan Hoad's Sound Manager
- Sphynx Motion Blur Toolkit
- Zylann's Heightmap Terrain
- Python (development only)

<!--
This game prominently uses libre and open source software libraries where they
have been proven to be solid enough solutions to problems that may have been
encountered throughout development.

Here's some of the libraries that are in use, installed using a quick and dirty
script written in Python to automate an otherwise manual process with future
plans to rewrite it either to a standalone program or as a
plugin written in GDScript with direct integration to the game engine.

# Conceptual Framework {.text-center.block.view-transition-title}

<!--
The game aims to narrate a story of sustainable development
through the narrative of a roleplaying driving game with a key feature including
a rich branching storyline driven by the player's actions. It uniquely has a
selling point of dealing with serious sustainability issues through the visage
of a fun and quirky driving roleplaying game.

# Algorithms In The Game {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

:: left ::

## Used

- Middleware system `O(n)`: Add functionality to cars without directly hard
  coding it into the car.
- Real time daylight cycle
- Dynamic camera effects
- Data-driven contextual dialog system **?**: Implementation remains incomplete and
  likely would only be finished past this term.

:: right ::

## Missing

- Behavior Tree based AI
- NoSQL binary serialization based save system: Implemented using Godot Resources
  with additional work done to prevent arbitrary code execution (potentially injecting
  malware)

<!--
As per the requirements of Algorithms and Complexity the following are algorithms
that have either been implemented or are missing in the game.

The most prominently observable algorithm is the middleware system where it is
used to great effect in enabling cars have features be removed and added rapidly

# Room for Improvements {.text-center.view-transition-title}

This was a ~~triumph~~ failure, I'm making a note here ~~"Huge success"~~ "Revolting"

As closing remarks and on par with researcher recommendations in other fields,
the group would like to acknowledge their shortcomings.

# Managerial Mishaps {.text-center.view-transition-title}

:: content ::

:img{src="/images/benson.jpg" .block.translate-x-3/2.translate-y-1/3} 

<!--
There need not for us to explain what had happened as it had already been discussed
in private but it is still appropriate if we had acknowledged this is a failure
thus room for improvement.

The group recommends that both present and future game development teams must
be stern with regards to their members as purposefully non-compliant personnel
are nothing more than a liability often costing everyone else their valuable
time and limited morale, resources better spent on the actual development of
the game in order to have something delivered and playable.

# Overpromising, Underdelivering {.text-center.view-transition-title}

:: left ::

The scope of the game had originally been intended to be the groundwork for their
respective theses with what is presented here being a major milestone

It is unfortunate that events out of our control and the aforementioned mishaps
had significantly impacted the progression of our work.

**Bitflip Softworks** hopes that nevertheless this sets their members up with
the experience and groundwork necessary for their thesis and/or future games,
software, and other works.

It is what is considered in **development hell** not helped by the battle over the rights
to the game that had demoralized the team's motivation.

# GAME'S FUTURE? {.text-center.block.view-transition-title}

*Too much stigma.* {.text-center.block.view-transition-subtitle}

<!--
For the lead developer Jeremy this game carries too much negative connotations for
him to have continued interest to work on this game.

While he will reuse aspects of the game such as parts of the plot and most
definitely the codebase, the game itself will not be continued upon and shall
be open sourced unless Joseph would like to take ownership otherwise.

Jeremy already has something planned for his next game moving forward.
